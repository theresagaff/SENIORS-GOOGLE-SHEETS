# New York’s growing senior population and its lack of resources: a disaster of numbers waiting to happen

The elderly population of New York is growing as the Baby Boomer generation ages into the over 65 age bracket. Perhaps people are snow-birding less, or otherwise deciding that the amenities available in New York are worth staying for. But there might not be enough facilities for older New Yorkers in certain areas.

Let’s break it down. The below graph plots out projected changes in the New York population by age group.

The age groups highlighted in red are all age groups over 65 years of age, in four year groupings. These populations trend up and are projected to grow over the next few decades, while some other populations see small decreases or a less consistent eb and flow.

The elderly population will grow in every borough over the next few decades, as shown above. Brooklyn has and will sustain the largest number of elderly community members, with Queens and Manhattan not far behind. But where are the resources for these community members?

The map above shows the concentration of all contracted senior centers registered with the city’s Department of Aging as provided by NYC Open Data. Senior centers are important gathering places where older community members can connect and socialize and learn.

The data shows that Brooklyn, which in 2020 has the most older residents and the most senior centers, provides one senior center per every 4,137 senior citizens. In Manhattan, the second highest for each category, that drops to one per every 3,918.

Boroughs with smaller numbers of older residents suffer even worse ratios. In Queens, there’s one senior center for every 6,138 people. Staten Island is home to the least number of senior citizens and therefore has only a quarter of the number of senior centers as the borough with the next lowest. There, they have one center per every 6,470 senior citizens.

The Bronx has the best rate of one center per 3,507 senior citizens—almost half the Staten Island rate.

If the population of those aged 65+ grows at the rate that the city predicts they will and no senior centers are added, the ratio for all boroughs will shoot up. By 2040, there would be one senior center in Staten Island available one for over 7,000 elderly residents.

Of course, not every senior wants to participate in senior center activities. According to the city, 166,882 people participated in senior center activities across the entire city in 2018. That’s only about 14% of the elderly population.

Still, the New York Department of Aging is trying to combat the lack of resources for seniors. The city introduced “Plan 2025” a couple years ago, to enhance the facilities for older New Yorkers that already exist in addition to creating more by the year 2025.
