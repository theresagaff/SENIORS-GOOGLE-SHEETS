          The elderly population of New York is growing as the Baby Boomer 
          generation ages into the over 65 age bracket. Perhaps people are 
          snow-birding less, or otherwise deciding that the amenities 
          available in New York are worth staying for. But there might not 
          be enough facilities for older New Yorkers in certain areas.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Let’s break it down. The below graph plots out projected changes 
          in the New York population by age group.

          The age groups highlighted in red are all age groups over 65 
          years of age, in four year groupings. These populations trend 
          up and are projected to grow over the next few decades, while 
          some other populations see small decreases or a less consistent 
          eb and flow.

          The map above shows the concentration of all contracted senior 
          centers registered with the city’s Department of Aging as 
          provided by <a href=https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Department-for-the-Aging-DFTA-All-Contracted-Provi/6j6t-3ixh>NYC Open Data</a>.  
          Senior centers are important gathering places where older 
          community members can connect and socialize and learn.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The data shows that Brooklyn, which in 2020 has the most older 
          residents and the most senior centers, provides one senior center 
          per every 4,137 senior citizens.  In Manhattan, the second highest 
          for each category, that drops to one per every 3,918. 
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Boroughs with smaller numbers of older residents suffer even worse 
          ratios.  In Queens, there’s one senior center for every 6,138 people.  
          Staten Island is home to the least number of senior citizens and 
          therefore has only a quarter of the number of senior centers as the 
          borough with the next lowest.  There, they have one center 
          per every 6,470 senior citizens.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The Bronx has the best rate of one center per 3,507 senior 
          citizens—almost half the Staten Island rate.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          If the population of those aged 65+ grows at the rate that the 
          city predicts they will and no senior centers are added, the ratio 
          for all boroughs will shoot up.  By 2040, there would be one senior 
          center in Staten Island available for over 7,000 elderly residents.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
        Of course, not every senior wants to participate in senior center activities.  
        According to the city, 166,882 people participated in senior center 
        activities across the entire city in 2018.  That’s only about 14% of the elderly population.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
        Still, the New York Department of Aging is trying to combat the lack of 
        resources for seniors.  The city introduced “Plan 2025” a couple years ago, 
        to enhance the facilities for older New Yorkers that already exist in addition 
        to creating more by the year 2025.
